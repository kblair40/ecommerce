TODO
8.  Fix image sizing on products pages, especially for jewelry
9.  Better form validations
10. User should be able to change their password
11. Cart should clear when order is submitted and modal providing order details should display.


EVENTUALLY
1.  Put available products into firebase and load from there
2.  User should be able to rate products and add products to their favorites
3.  if items are in cart and user leaves/logs out, cart should be saved and reloaded automatically on next login
